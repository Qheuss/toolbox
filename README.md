## My personnal toolbox

*Ongoing project

I built this toolbox with Next.js, and I'm continuously improving it. My goal is to gather different useful features and keep expanding it with new tools over time. This project also serves as a playground for me to explore modern web technologies and strengthen my front-end development skills.
